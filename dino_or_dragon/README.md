# Dino or Dragon project

This project corresponds to homework 8 of the datatalks [zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp) ML course 2022.

We build a model to predict if we have an image of a dino or a dragon. For this, we will use the "Dino or Dragon?" dataset that can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agrigorev/dino-or-dragon). 

The trained model is saved in a file too large to upload, but you can see how it was trained and the test at the bottom of the notebook. Since it is a binary classification model, the result 0 is dino and 1 is dragon. The model answers a number between 0 and 1 according to the loaded image.
