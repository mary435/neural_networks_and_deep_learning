# Clothing Classification Proyect

This project corresponds to the lectures of unit 8 of the datatalks [zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp) ML course 2022.   

We use this [small dataset](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset-small). This is a subset of the [full clothing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/agrigorev/clothing-dataset-full) with the top-10 most popular classes.

The trained model is saved in a file too large to upload, but you can see how it was trained and the test at the bottom of the notebook. 
Since it is a multiclass classification model, the result obtained is a number for each established class. The model responds with a number between -10 and 10 depending on the uploaded image.
